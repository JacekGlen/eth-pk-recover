## Introduction

Account abstraction involves modifying the Ethereum account model to allow for more flexibility and modularity. This includes the introduction of new types of accounts and potentially a refined gas model. The idea is to enable new use cases and improve the overall efficiency of the Ethereum network.

The main goals of account abstraction might include:

Introduction of Multiple Account Types: Enabling the creation of various account types beyond externally owned accounts and contract accounts. This could include new account structures that provide different features or functionalities.

Gas Model Refinement: Improving the existing gas model by considering the complexity and resource requirements of different account types. This aims to create a more accurate pricing mechanism for transactions based on the specific operations performed by each type of account.

Enhanced Privacy and Security: Implementing features within the account abstraction framework to improve privacy and security, potentially by allowing for more sophisticated key management and access control mechanisms.

Flexible Smart Contract Execution: Allowing for more flexible and modular execution of smart contracts. This could involve changes to the way contracts are executed or instantiated on the Ethereum network.
